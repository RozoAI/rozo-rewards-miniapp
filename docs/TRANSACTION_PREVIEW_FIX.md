# "Transaction Preview Unavailable" Error Fix

## üîç Problem Diagnosis

Based on the [official Coinbase Spend Permissions documentation](https://github.com/coinbase/spend-permissions/tree/main), the "Transaction preview unavailable" and "Unable to estimate asset changes" errors are caused by **smart contract authorization issues**.

## üö® Root Cause

According to the official documentation:

> "The `SpendPermissionManager` singleton is added as an owner of the user's smart wallet, giving it the ability to move user funds on behalf of a sender within the tight constraints of the spend permission logic."

**The issue**: The `SpendPermissionManager` contract is not properly authorized as an owner of the user's Coinbase Smart Wallet, preventing transaction previews and asset change estimations.

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Diagnostic Functions Added**

We added comprehensive diagnostic functions based on the official Coinbase standard:

```typescript
// Check if SpendPermissionManager is approved as wallet owner
async checkSpendPermissionManagerApproval(userAddress: string): Promise<boolean>

// Check if a specific spend permission is approved on-chain  
async isSpendPermissionApproved(spendPermission: SpendPermission): Promise<boolean>
```

### 2. **Enhanced Error Detection**

The application now detects and reports when:

- SpendPermissionManager is not approved as a wallet owner
- Spend permissions are not properly authorized
- Network configuration issues exist

### 3. **User-Friendly Error Messages**

When the SpendPermissionManager approval issue is detected, users see:

```
Transaction preview unavailable: SpendPermissionManager needs approval. 
Please authorize spend permissions first.
```

### 4. **Network Configuration Fix**

Added proper Base mainnet configuration:

- **SpendPermissionManager**: `0xf85210B21cC50302F477BA56686d2019dC9b67Ad`
- **USDC Token**: `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`
- **Base Chain ID**: `8453`

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Contract Authorization Check

```typescript
const isOwner = await publicClient.readContract({
  address: userAddress as Address,
  abi: [
    {
      inputs: [{ name: 'owner', type: 'address' }],
      name: 'isOwnerAddress', 
      outputs: [{ name: '', type: 'bool' }],
      stateMutability: 'view',
      type: 'function',
    },
  ],
  functionName: 'isOwnerAddress',
  args: [SpendPermissionManager_ADDRESS],
});
```

### Spend Permission Approval Check

```typescript
const hash = await publicClient.readContract({
  address: SpendPermissionManager_ADDRESS,
  abi: SPEND_PERMISSION_MANAGER_ABI,
  functionName: 'getHash',
  args: [spendPermission],
});

const isApproved = await publicClient.readContract({
  address: SpendPermissionManager_ADDRESS, 
  abi: SPEND_PERMISSION_MANAGER_ABI,
  functionName: 'isApproved',
  args: [spendPermission.account, hash],
});
```

## üìã User Resolution Steps

When users encounter "Transaction preview unavailable", they need to:

1. **Authorize Spend Permissions**: Complete the authorization flow to add SpendPermissionManager as a wallet owner
2. **Verify Network**: Ensure wallet is connected to Base mainnet (Chain ID: 8453)
3. **Check USDC Balance**: Ensure sufficient USDC for the transaction
4. **Retry Transaction**: After authorization, the transaction preview should work

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration

Set the following environment variables for proper operation:

```bash
# Use Base mainnet for production
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MAINNET=true

# NS Cafe merchant address
NEXT_PUBLIC_NS_CAFE_ADDRESS=0x5772FBe7a7817ef7F586215CA8b23b8dD22C8897
```

## üß™ Testing the Fix

1. Connect wallet to the application
2. Check browser console for diagnostic messages:
   - `üîç SpendPermissionManager approval status: true/false`
   - `üí° SpendPermissionManager not approved...` (if issue exists)
3. Authorization flow should properly add SpendPermissionManager as owner
4. Transaction previews should work after proper authorization

This implementation follows the official Coinbase Spend Permissions standard and provides clear diagnostic information to help users resolve authorization issues.
